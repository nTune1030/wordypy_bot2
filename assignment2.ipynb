    "# Assignment 2: Do you see what I see?\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of _WordyPy_ that we worked on in the last module was pretty basic, and with our newfound knowledge of image\n",
    "manipulation it seems reasonable for us to increase the visual appeal here a bit. In this assignment I've modified the\n",
    "`GameEngine` so that it returns an image to your bot -- your job is to be able to process that image and keep your bot\n",
    "functioning!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for the software has changed a bit, here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### `GameEngine`\n",
    "\n",
    "I have changed the `GameEngine` class to now return a `PIL.Image` object when the `play` method is called. While it\n",
    "doesn't sound like much of a change, it means that you need to use image manipulation to determine whether a letter was\n",
    "in the correct place, in the word but not in the correct place, or not in the word at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `DisplaySpecification`\n",
    "\n",
    "While I demonstrate below how this looks using the Michigan blue and maize color scheme, I thought it would be nice to\n",
    "allow future users of _WordPy_ to customize the look and feel, so your code needs to be able to get this new\n",
    "`DisplaySpecification` and use it to solve the game. In this assignment the `GameEngine` will use the\n",
    "`DisplaySpecification` defaults, so you can access the member attributes of the class directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Letter`\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is unchanged, but you still need to provide the code for it! I recommend copying you solution for assignment\n",
    "1 here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Bot`\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest change to your `Bot` is that the `record_guess_results()` method no longer takes a list of letters, but an\n",
    "image. To deal with this image you need to implement two helper methods which are private (remember: if a function or\n",
    "method starts with an underscore in python the intention is for it to be private to the class). Our autograder will be\n",
    "testing each of these functions to ensure that they work properly, so there's a brief discussion of them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing the method `Bot._tuple_to_str(self, pixels: tuple) -> str`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the python imaging library to explore pixel values you generally get them back as a tuple, with each value\n",
    "being an integer representation of a single color band. The `GameEngine` uses web hex color codes instead, so you'll\n",
    "need to translate the tuple representation into a hex string equivalent. **This should be one of the first functions you\n",
    "write.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the tuple values of `(186, 12, 47, 255)` in an RGBA image would convert to the hex string value of\n",
    "`#BA0C2F`. Three things to note about your implementation of this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It must return hex values in upper case only\n",
    "2. It must start with the hash mark (#) to indicate they are web hex colors\n",
    "3. It must only consider the first three values in the tuple, and ignore any other values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing the method `Bot._process_image(self, guess: str, guess_image: PIL.Image) -> list[Letter]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Bot._process_image` method takes two parameters, a `PIL.Image` which is the output from the game engine, and a\n",
    "guess, as a string. This method needs to be wired up in your `record_guess_results()` method so that when the game\n",
    "engine passes a new image you first decode it to a list of letters then record the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The new architecture diagram for WordyPy is the following (bold indicates new elements from assignment 1):\n",
    "![Architecture Diagram of WordyPy for Assignment 2](py3_assignment2.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring the new `GameEngine`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to know how to use the new `GameEngine` for development. In this assignment you can create a new\n",
    "`GameEngine` for testing with your target word directly, then you can call its' `evaluate_guess()` method and pass in a\n",
    "`Guess` for a work which you have chosen. This allows you to see the result in the Jupyter notebook directly using the\n",
    "`display()` function. Here's a worked example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# create new GameEngine with a target word of \"field\" and then\n",
    "# show what it returns when we guess \"lives\"\n",
    "guess = Guess(\"lives\")\n",
    "image = GameEngine(\"field\").evaluate_guess(guess)\n",
    "print(image)\n",
    "display(image)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output: ![Example Output of GameEngine.evaluate_guess()](output1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to run this you _must_ first copy over your working `Letter` implementation from the first assignment, and you\n",
    "_must_ run the cell below which has the new `GameEngine` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that when we print the PIL.Image object we get some information about its parameters (e.g. the image\n",
    "mode and size). When we call the `display()` the object we see the word has one letter in the correct position (the \"I\",\n",
    "shown on a dark blue background) and two letters which are in the word but in the incorrect position (the \"L\" and the\n",
    "\"E\", shown on a maize colored background).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_tuple_to_str` private method of your `Bot` is one of the first ones you should write! Here is some code you can\n",
    "use to test this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the pixel values as an RGBA series\n",
    "pixels=(0,43,12,255)\n",
    "print(Bot._tuple_to_str(pixels))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of the output running on my solution for the assignment:\n",
    "![Example Output of Bot._tuple_to_str() function](output2.png)\n"
